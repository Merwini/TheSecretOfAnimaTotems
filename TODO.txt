Plants:
	- anima sapling
		- mini version of anima tree, that you can have multiple of
		- can link animus cairns, to buff pawns meditating near them (limit the number of linkables, to encourage player to specialize)
		- does not produce resources
		- lesser anima scream

Buildings
	- Animus cairns, structures made from jade and anima (bark?) that have effects on pawns that meditate near the linked anima sapling, probably as a temporary hediff
		- serenity, reduces mental break threshold
		- zeal, increases combat abilities
		- 
	- Animus totems, structures made from jade that have various effects on the linked anima tree, or colony-wide effects (again, limit number of linkables to encourage player to specialize their colony)
		- maybe allow player to increase linkable cap, like deathrest capacity serum does
		- generosity, increases production of anima bark
		- persistence, makes buffs from cairns last longer


Code stuff:
	custom CompProperties_AffectedByFacilities that limits links
	custom PlaceWorker for totems, one for cairns
